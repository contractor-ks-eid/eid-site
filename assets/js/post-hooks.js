// hooks can be any function that was not yet executed at the moment when this script is loaded
// it works both with functions already defined in the global scope (window.func = () => {...})
// or with functions that are not in the global scope, but defined in the classical way, not as arrow functions
// these are useful when needed to extend the functionality of functions that are executed based on user action (e.g. click on buttons)
// these can use any asset, function, object and accessible variable of the site
